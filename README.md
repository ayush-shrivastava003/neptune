A simple interpreter built in Rust. Based on the code [here](https://github.com/ayush-shrivastava003/language) (see repo to find resources to help you build an interpreter of your own).

[Here](https://github.com/jeschkies/lox-rs)'s another additional resource that helped me a LOT since I'm still pretty new to Rust.
